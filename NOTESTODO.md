# Notes / To fix later

## Parameter categorization
- Review and correct parameter groupings. Example: **Cholesterol** (Total, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides, etc.) should be under **Lipid profile** and linked to **heart health** suggestions, not mixed under generic "Blood".
- Other opportunity areas may exist (Liver, Kidney, Thyroid, etc.). Audit categories against clinical conventions and UX.
