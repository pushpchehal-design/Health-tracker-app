# Supabase Edge Functions

## Deploy analyze-health-report

- When you change `supabase/functions/analyze-health-report/index.ts` (or the user asks to deploy or redeploy the health report function), **run the deploy command automatically**. Do not ask the user for confirmation.
- Use this command from the project root:
  ```bash
  cd "/Users/pushapkantchehal/Health Tracker/health-tracker-app" && npx supabase functions deploy analyze-health-report
  ```
- If `supabase` is not in PATH, use `npx supabase` as above.
